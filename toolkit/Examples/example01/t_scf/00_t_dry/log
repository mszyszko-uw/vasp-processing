|     Your highest band is occupied at some k-points! Unless you are          |
|     performing a calculation for an insulator or semiconductor, without     |
|     unoccupied bands, you have included TOO FEW BANDS!! Please increase     |
|     the parameter NBANDS in file INCAR to ensure that the highest band      |
|     is unoccupied at all k-points. It is always recommended to include      |
|     a few unoccupied bands to accelerate the convergence of                 |
|     molecular-dynamics runs (even for insulators or semiconductors),        |
|     since the presence of unoccupied bands improves wavefunction            |
|     prediction and helps to suppress 'band-crossings'.                      |
