Assumptions:
- We use VASP 6.5.1 or newer
- Calculations, pre- and postprocessing is done on HPC clusters with SLURM
- Pre- and postprocessing can be also done on local few-cores computers
- Postprocess vaspout.h5 file as much as possible
- Instead of WAVECAR and CHGCAR, use vaspwave.h5 - NOT YET POSSIBLE
- Use array jobs 
- User provides the starting POSCARs 
- Use recommended PBE POTCARs, located in a directory on the cluster
- After each task finishes (succesfully or crash) a report is produced  
- We always KEEP files: INCAR, POSCAR, POTCAR, KPOINTS, EIGENVAL, log, OSZICAR, OUTCAR, *.h5, IBZKPT, err, job.sh
- We always REMOVE files: REPORT, XDATACAR, PCDAT
- Depending on task, we (parse and) REMOVE files: WAVECAR, CHG*, WAVEDER*, PROCAR, vasprun.xml, BSEFATBAND, CONTCAR

Name of task:
